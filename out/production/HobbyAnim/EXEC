EXEC
This is the file where I'll document project style, goals, and framework.
Much like a readme, but more oriented for the developer.
NOTE TO SELF: It's not a clusterfuck if everything is there for a reason.

===

STYLE

    Indentation: 4 spaces. I'm too lazy to change the editor defaults.

    Parentheses: Right next to the keyword. functionName(), if(), while(), etc.

    Brackets: 1 whitespace line in between significant parts of the code and when changing indentation - for example:
        ~
        class MyClass {

            // variable declaration

            MyClass() {

                // code
                // more code

            }

            void myFunction() {

                // code
                // more code

            }

        }
        //
        Seems excessive, but your eyes will thank you in the future probably.
        As for tiny methods like getters and one-line methods, those can all stay in one line like so:
        //
        /**
         * JavaDoc comment for this method.
         */
        Object getObject() { return myObject; }
        ~
        East enough.

    Commenting: JavaDoc comments for every method and constructor. Regular comments throughout for explanation, only
        before whitespace. @author, @version on every file that the class/interface/enum header. @version on any
        significant method.
        Also, Javadoc on blocks of variables - if small enough, use a single-line Javadoc comment.
            ~
            /** Single-line Javadoc comment. */
            ~
        For extremely significant sections of code, head them with a title comment:
            ~
            // --- Title ---
            ~
        Special note: anonymous classes do not need full JavaDoc comments.

GOALS

    The old animator project (titled Animator) failed a bit due to its lack of focus. This one includes an EXEC file,
    which is surely a step in the right direction.

    My primary goal is completion - I believe that creating a new software for animation will be a great utility and help
    to myself and other hobby animators who can't effectively use the alternatives.

    My secondary goal is neatness - programmers say that there isn't such thing as perfect and neat code, and this isn't
    an act of defiance but I definitely want to test the waters when working on my first major project. That also means
    committing more to Git, and managing branches when I just want to try something, which I failed to do last time.

    My tertiary goal is consistency - one of my personal main problems while designing programs has been flipping back
    and forth between what I want my coding style to be. EXEC will help manage that, ideally.

    My quaternary goal is to stop being so idealist.

FRAMEWORK

    (The actual workings of the project.)

    HobbyAnim.class

        Main class that the entire program can refer to. Will contain methods for managing undo/execute as well as a host
        of constant variables. It extends JFrame and is the main window of the program.

    CanvasPanel.class

        Drawing area.

        CanvasPanelAdapter

    CursorTool.class

        Performs actions based on what tool is currently in use.
        It is an enum with a constructor, with arguments for 1. the UndoCommand created by a mouse release.

    .vector

        Package for vector graphics. Includes typical pen strokes, lines, etc.

    .animation

        Package that contains animation-specific components: layers and keyframes, basically.
        Layer and KeyFrame in .animation both have specialized overloaded ways of using HashMap.put. Instead of taking
        a K and V argument and returning the value, the new put method takes in only a value, auto-generates the key,
        and returns the key. This is to help the UndoCommands that run the program.
